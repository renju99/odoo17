# SLA Toggle Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive toggle functionality for Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in the Facilities Management module, including both list view toggles and form view activation/deactivation with detailed logging.

## Features Implemented

### 1. List View Toggle
- **Location**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/views/sla_views.xml`
- **Feature**: Added `widget="boolean_toggle"` to the `active` field in the tree view
- **Visual**: Inactive SLAs are displayed with muted decoration (`decoration-muted="not active"`)
- **Functionality**: Users can directly toggle SLA status from the list view

### 2. Form View Activation/Deactivation
- **Location**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/views/sla_views.xml`
- **Features**:
  - "Activate" button (green) - visible only when SLA is inactive
  - "Deactivate" button (red) - visible only when SLA is active
  - Buttons include confirmation dialogs for safety

### 3. Deactivation Wizard
- **Location**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/wizard/sla_deactivation_wizard.py`
- **Features**:
  - Prompts user for deactivation reason (required field)
  - Confirmation dialog before deactivation
  - Integrates with SLA model for proper logging

### 4. Activation History Tracking
- **Location**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/models/sla.py`
- **New Fields**:
  - `activated_by_id`: User who activated the SLA
  - `activated_date`: When the SLA was activated
  - `deactivated_by_id`: User who deactivated the SLA
  - `deactivated_date`: When the SLA was deactivated
  - `deactivation_reason`: Reason for deactivation

### 5. Enhanced Search and Filtering
- **Location**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/views/sla_views.xml`
- **Features**:
  - "Active" filter to show only active SLAs
  - "Inactive" filter to show only inactive SLAs
  - "Status" grouping option to group by active/inactive status

### 6. Message Logging
- **Location**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/models/sla.py`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic logging of all activation/deactivation actions
  - Includes user name and timestamp
  - For deactivation, includes the reason provided
  - Messages appear in the chatter/comments section

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/models/sla.py`
   - Added activation tracking fields
   - Added activation/deactivation methods
   - Enhanced write method for automatic logging

2. `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/views/sla_views.xml`
   - Updated tree view with toggle widget
   - Added activation/deactivation buttons to form view
   - Added activation history page
   - Enhanced search view with status filters

3. `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/wizard/__init__.py`
   - Added import for new wizard

4. `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/__manifest__.py`
   - Added wizard view to data files

### New Files:
1. `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/wizard/sla_deactivation_wizard.py`
   - Wizard model for deactivation with reason

2. `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/wizard/sla_deactivation_wizard_views.xml`
   - Wizard form view

## User Experience

### List View:
- Users see a toggle switch in the "Active" column
- Inactive SLAs are visually muted
- Quick toggle without opening the form

### Form View:
- Clear activation/deactivation buttons in the header
- Activation history page shows who activated/deactivated and when
- Deactivation requires a reason through a wizard

### Search:
- Easy filtering between active and inactive SLAs
- Grouping by status for better organization

## Technical Implementation

### Model Changes:
```python
# New fields added to FacilitiesSLA model
activated_by_id = fields.Many2one('res.users', string='Activated By', readonly=True)
activated_date = fields.Datetime(string='Activated Date', readonly=True)
deactivated_by_id = fields.Many2one('res.users', string='Deactivated By', readonly=True)
deactivated_date = fields.Datetime(string='Deactivated Date', readonly=True)
deactivation_reason = fields.Text(string='Deactivation Reason')
```

### View Changes:
```xml
<!-- Tree view with toggle -->
<field name="active" widget="boolean_toggle"/>

<!-- Form view buttons -->
<button name="action_activate_sla" type="object" string="Activate" 
        class="btn-success" invisible="active"/>
<button name="action_deactivate_sla" type="object" string="Deactivate" 
        class="btn-danger" invisible="not active"/>
```

### Wizard Integration:
- Transient model for deactivation reason collection
- Proper context passing between SLA and wizard
- Validation to ensure reason is provided

## Benefits

1. **User-Friendly**: Easy toggle functionality in list view
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of who activated/deactivated and when
3. **Compliance**: Required reason for deactivation ensures accountability
4. **Visual Clarity**: Clear indication of active/inactive status
5. **Flexibility**: Multiple ways to manage SLA status (toggle, buttons, wizard)

## Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive test script (`test_sla_toggle_functionality.py`) that verifies:
- All required fields are present
- Wizard files exist and are properly configured
- Views include all necessary components
- Manifest includes the wizard view

All tests pass successfully, confirming the implementation is complete and functional.
