# SLA Performance Report Fix Summary

## Problem
The Odoo server was throwing an error when trying to generate an SLA performance report:

```
ValueError: External ID not found in the system: facilities_management.sla_performance_report
```

This error occurred because:
1. The SLA model (`facilities.sla.dashboard`) was trying to reference a report action that didn't exist
2. The `action_export_report` method in the SLA model was incorrectly trying to return a report action without proper document IDs
3. The report template and action were missing from the module

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was traced to line 506 in `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/models/sla.py`:

```python
def action_export_report(self):
    """Export SLA performance report"""
    return {
        'type': 'ir.actions.report',
        'report_name': 'facilities_management.sla_performance_report',
        'report_type': 'qweb-pdf',
        'data': {
            'sla_id': self.sla_id.id,
            'date_from': self.date_from,
            'date_to': self.date_to
        }
    }
```

This method was trying to reference a report that didn't exist in the system.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Missing Report File
Created `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/reports/sla_performance_report.xml` with:

- **Report Action**: `action_sla_performance_report` that binds to the `facilities.sla.dashboard` model
- **Report Template**: `sla_performance_report` with comprehensive SLA performance metrics
- **Features**:
  - SLA details and configuration information
  - Performance metrics (compliance rate, MTTR, first-time fix rate)
  - Daily compliance trend analysis
  - Weekly trend analysis
  - Intelligent recommendations based on performance thresholds

### 2. Updated Module Manifest
Added the new report file to `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/__manifest__.py`:

```python
'data': [
    # ... existing entries ...
    'reports/sla_performance_report.xml',
    # ... rest of entries ...
],
```

### 3. Fixed SLA Model Method
Updated the `action_export_report` method in `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/models/sla.py`:

```python
def action_export_report(self):
    """Export SLA performance report"""
    # Create or get the SLA dashboard record
    dashboard = self.env['facilities.sla.dashboard'].create({
        'sla_id': self.sla_id.id,
        'date_from': self.date_from,
        'date_to': self.date_to
    })
    
    # Return the report action
    return {
        'type': 'ir.actions.report',
        'report_name': 'facilities_management.sla_performance_report',
        'report_type': 'qweb-pdf',
        'data': {
            'doc_ids': [dashboard.id],
            'doc_model': 'facilities.sla.dashboard',
        }
    }
```

### 4. XML Syntax Fixes
Fixed XML syntax issues in the report template:
- Escaped comparison operators (`<` → `&lt;`, `>` → `&gt;`)
- Removed emoji characters that could cause parsing issues
- Ensured proper XML structure and formatting

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/reports/sla_performance_report.xml`
2. **Modified**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/__manifest__.py`
3. **Modified**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/models/sla.py`

## Testing
Created and ran a comprehensive test script (`test_sla_report_fix.py`) that validates:
- ✅ XML syntax correctness
- ✅ Manifest inclusion
- ✅ SLA model fix implementation

All tests passed successfully.

## Result
The error `External ID not found in the system: facilities_management.sla_performance_report` should now be resolved. The SLA performance report functionality is now properly implemented and should work correctly when users try to generate SLA performance reports.

## Next Steps
1. Restart the Odoo server to load the new report
2. Update the facilities_management module in Odoo
3. Test the SLA performance report generation functionality

The fix ensures that the SLA performance reporting feature works as intended and provides comprehensive insights into SLA compliance and performance metrics.
