# SLA Views Enhanced Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes and enhancements applied to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) views and functionality in the Facilities Management module for Odoo 17.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "No Current Group Assigned" Error
**Problem**: The SLA form view was throwing a "no current group assigned" error when trying to modify SLAs.

**Root Cause**: The `invisible="active"` attribute in the "Deactivation Info" group was incorrectly configured, causing the view to fail when the SLA was active.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `invisible="active"` to `invisible="not active"` in line 98 of `sla_views.xml`
- This ensures the deactivation info group is only shown when the SLA is inactive

**File**: `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/views/sla_views.xml`
