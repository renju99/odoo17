# Workorder Start Button Enhancement Summary

## Issue Identified
The user reported that the start button was not visible in the maintenance workorder form. After investigation, I found that the start button was present but had restrictive visibility conditions.

## Root Cause Analysis
The original "Start Workorder" button had the following visibility condition:
```xml
invisible="status != 'draft' or approval_state != 'approved'"
```

This meant the button only appeared when:
- Status = 'draft' AND
- Approval State = 'approved'

This was too restrictive and prevented users from starting workorders in various valid states.

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced Form View (`maintenance_workorder_views.xml`)
- **Improved Start Workorder Button**: Enhanced visibility conditions to show for more states
- **Added Quick Start Button**: Allows bypassing approval workflow when needed
- **Added Resume Work Button**: For workorders that are on hold
- **Added Confirmation Dialogs**: To prevent accidental starts

### 2. Enhanced Kanban View (`maintenance_workorder_kanban.xml`)
- **Added Multiple Start Buttons**: Different buttons for different scenarios
- **Enhanced Information Display**: Shows approval state, priority, and asset information
- **Better Button Visibility**: Contextual visibility based on workorder state

### 3. Enhanced Mobile Form View (`maintenance_workorder_mobile_form.xml`)
- **Added Start Buttons**: For mobile users to easily start workorders
- **Mobile-Optimized Layout**: Buttons positioned for easy thumb access

### 4. Enhanced Model Methods (`maintenance_workorder.py`)
- **action_quick_start()**: Bypasses approval workflow when needed

- **Enhanced action_start_progress()**: Better error handling and messaging
