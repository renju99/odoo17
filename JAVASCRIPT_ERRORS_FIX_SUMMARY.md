# JavaScript Errors Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. "Layout was forced before the page was fully loaded" Error

**Problem:** The error "Layout was forced before the page was fully loaded" was occurring because JavaScript was trying to manipulate the DOM before stylesheets were loaded.

**Root Cause:** The dashboard widget was performing layout operations before CSS was fully loaded, causing a flash of unstyled content (FOUC).

**Solution Applied:**
- **File:** `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/static/src/js/dashboard_widgets.js`
- **Enhanced `_ensureLayoutReady()` method** with proper timing:
  ```javascript
  _ensureLayoutReady() {
      // Strategy 1: Check if document is ready
      if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
          document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
              this._waitForStylesheets();
          });
      } else {
          this._waitForStylesheets();
      }
  }

  _waitForStylesheets() {
      // Strategy 2: Wait for stylesheets to load
      const stylesheets = Array.from(document.styleSheets);
      const unloadedStylesheets = stylesheets.filter(sheet => {
          try {
              return sheet.href && !sheet.href.startsWith('data:') && sheet.cssRules.length === 0;
          } catch (e) {
              return false;
          }
      });

      if (unloadedStylesheets.length === 0) {
          // All stylesheets loaded, proceed
          this._performLayoutOperations();
      } else {
          // Wait for remaining stylesheets with fallback timeout
          let loadedCount = 0;
          const totalStylesheets = unloadedStylesheets.length;
          
          unloadedStylesheets.forEach(sheet => {
              const link = document.querySelector(`link[href="${sheet.href}"]`);
              if (link) {
                  link.addEventListener('load', () => {
                      loadedCount++;
                      if (loadedCount === totalStylesheets) {
                          this._performLayoutOperations();
                      }
                  });
              }
          });
          
          // Fallback: proceed after a reasonable timeout
          setTimeout(() => {
              if (!this.isLayoutReady) {
                  this._performLayoutOperations();
              }
          }, 2000);
      }
  }
  ```

### 2. "unreachable code after return statement" Error

**Problem:** Multiple instances of unreachable code after return statements were causing JavaScript errors.

**Root Cause:** The `_getCurrentLocation()` method in the mobile scanner was not properly handling async operations.

**Solution Applied:**
- **File:** `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/static/src/js/mobile_scanner.js`
- **Fixed `_getCurrentLocation()` method** to return proper Promise:
  ```javascript
  _getCurrentLocation() {
      if (navigator.geolocation) {
          return new Promise((resolve) => {
              navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
                  resolve({
                      latitude: position.coords.latitude,
                      longitude: position.coords.longitude
                  });
              }, () => {
                  resolve(null);
              });
          });
      }
      return Promise.resolve(null);
  }
  ```

- **Fixed `_updateAssetLocation()` method** to properly await the location:
  ```javascript
  async _updateAssetLocation(asset) {
      try {
          const location = await this._getCurrentLocation();
          
          await this.orm.write('facilities.asset', [asset.id], {
              last_scan_location: location ? `${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}` : 'Unknown',
              last_scan_time: new Date().toISOString()
          });
          
          this.notification.add(_t('Asset location updated successfully'), { type: 'success' });
      } catch (error) {
          console.error('Failed to update asset location:', error);
          this.notification.add(_t('Failed to update asset location'), { type: 'danger' });
      }
  }
  ```

### 3. CSS Loading and Layout Issues

**Problem:** Layout was being forced before CSS was fully loaded, causing flash of unstyled content.

**Solution Applied:**
- **File:** `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/static/src/css/facilities.css`
- **Added loading states and transitions:**
  ```css
  /* Prevent layout issues during loading */
  .facilities-dashboard {
      min-height: 100vh;
      opacity: 0;
      transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
      /* Prevent layout calculations until ready */
      visibility: hidden;
  }

  .facilities-dashboard.loaded {
      opacity: 1;
      visibility: visible;
  }

  /* Prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) */
  .o_web_client {
      /* Ensure layout is not calculated until ready */
      min-height: 100vh;
  }

  /* Ensure proper loading sequence */
  .facilities-dashboard:not(.loaded) {
      /* Hide content until JavaScript is ready */
      display: none;
  }

  .facilities-dashboard.loaded {
      display: block;
  }
  ```

### 4. Asset Loading Order Issues

**Problem:** JavaScript files were loading before dependencies like Chart.js were available.

**Solution Applied:**
- **File:** `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/__manifest__.py`
- **Updated asset loading order** with proper comments:
  ```python
  'assets': {
      'web.assets_backend': [
          # Include Chart.js library first
          ('include', 'web.chartjs_lib'),
          # CSS files - load before JavaScript
          'facilities_management/static/src/css/facilities.css',
          'facilities_management/static/src/css/portal.css',
          # JavaScript files in dependency order - load after CSS
          'facilities_management/static/src/js/dashboard_widgets.js',
          'facilities_management/static/src/js/iot_monitoring.js',
          'facilities_management/static/src/js/mobile_scanner.js',
          # XML templates - load last
          'facilities_management/static/src/xml/*.xml',
      ],
  }
  ```
