# SLA Views Odoo 17 Compatibility Fix

## Issue Description

The Odoo server was throwing a `ParseError` when trying to upgrade the `facilities_management` module due to deprecated view attributes in Odoo 17.

**Error Message:**
```
odoo.tools.convert.ParseError: while parsing /home/ranjith/odoo_projects/odoo17/addons/facilities_management/views/sla_views.xml:5
Since 17.0, the "attrs" and "states" attributes are no longer used.
View: facilities.sla.form (facilities_management.view_facilities_sla_form) in facilities_management/views/sla_views.xml
```

## Root Cause

In Odoo 17, the `attrs` and `states` attributes have been deprecated and replaced with direct attribute syntax. The specific issue was in the SLA form view where an `attrs` attribute was used to conditionally show/hide a group based on the `active` field.

## Fix Applied

**File:** `/workspace/odoo17/addons/facilities_management/views/sla_views.xml`

**Line 98:** Changed from deprecated `attrs` syntax to new Odoo 17 syntax.

### Before (Deprecated):
```xml
<group string="Deactivation Info" attrs="{'invisible': [('active', '=', True)]}">
```

### After (Odoo 17 Compatible):
```xml
<group string="Deactivation Info" invisible="active">
```

## Technical Details

### Odoo 17 View Attribute Changes

1. **`attrs` attribute removal**: The `attrs` attribute that used dictionary syntax for conditional visibility has been replaced with direct attribute syntax.

2. **New syntax patterns**:
   - Old: `attrs="{'invisible': [('field', '=', value)]}"`
   - New: `invisible="field"` or `invisible="field == value"`

3. **`states` attribute removal**: The `states` attribute has been completely removed in favor of the new attribute syntax.

## Validation

The fix was validated using a custom validation script that:
- ✅ Confirmed XML syntax is valid
- ✅ Verified no deprecated attributes remain
- ✅ Checked for Odoo 17 compatible attribute patterns

## Impact

This fix resolves the module upgrade error and allows the `facilities_management` module to be properly installed/upgraded in Odoo 17. The functionality remains the same - the "Deactivation Info" group will still be hidden when the SLA is active.

## Files Modified

- `odoo17/addons/facilities_management/views/sla_views.xml` (Line 98)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Upgrade the `facilities_management` module in Odoo 17
2. Verify the SLA form view loads correctly
3. Test that the "Deactivation Info" group visibility works as expected
4. Ensure no other view-related errors occur during module installation
