# ESG Reporting Module Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The Odoo 17 installation was failing with the following error:

```
FileNotFoundError: File not found: esg_reporting/views/esg_report_wizard_views.xml
```

This error occurred when trying to install or upgrade the ESG reporting module because the `__manifest__.py` file was referencing a view file that didn't exist.

## Root Cause

The `__manifest__.py` file in the `esg_reporting` module was trying to load a file called `views/esg_report_wizard_views.xml`, but this file was missing from the views directory. Instead, the correct file was named `views/enhanced_esg_wizard_views.xml`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed the Manifest File

**File:** `odoo17/addons/esg_reporting/__manifest__.py`

**Change:** Removed the reference to the missing file and kept only the correct file reference.

**Before:**
```python
'data': [
    'security/esg_security.xml',
    'security/ir.model.access.csv',
    'views/esg_report_wizard_views.xml',  # ❌ This file doesn't exist
    'views/enhanced_esg_wizard_views.xml',
    # ... other files
],
```

**After:**
```python
'data': [
    'security/esg_security.xml',
    'security/ir.model.access.csv',
    'views/enhanced_esg_wizard_views.xml',  # ✅ This file exists
    # ... other files
],
```

### 2. Verified Module Structure

All required files are present in the module:

- ✅ `__init__.py` - Module initialization
- ✅ `__manifest__.py` - Module manifest (fixed)
- ✅ `wizard/__init__.py` - Wizard package initialization
- ✅ `wizard/esg_report_wizard.py` - Enhanced ESG wizard model
- ✅ `views/enhanced_esg_wizard_views.xml` - Wizard views
- ✅ `security/esg_security.xml` - Security rules
- ✅ `security/ir.model.access.csv` - Access rights
- ✅ `data/esg_data.xml` - Initial data
- ✅ `data/esg_demo.xml` - Demo data
- ✅ `report/esg_reports.xml` - Report definitions
- ✅ `report/esg_report_templates.xml` - Report templates

## Verification

The fix was verified using a test script that:

1. ✅ Confirmed the missing file reference was removed from manifest
2. ✅ Confirmed the correct file reference is present
3. ✅ Verified all referenced files exist in the filesystem
4. ✅ Checked that all required module files are present

## Expected Result

After this fix, the ESG reporting module should:

1. Load successfully without FileNotFoundError
2. Install/upgrade properly in Odoo
3. Provide access to the Enhanced ESG Report wizard
4. Display all ESG reporting functionality in the Odoo interface

## Next Steps

To complete the setup:

1. Restart your Odoo server
2. Go to Apps → Update Apps List
3. Search for "Facilities Management Module" (the ESG reporting module)
4. Install or upgrade the module
5. The module should now load without errors

## Technical Details

- **Module Name:** Facilities Management Module (esg_reporting)
- **Odoo Version:** 17.0
- **Issue Type:** Missing file reference in manifest
- **Fix Type:** Manifest file correction
- **Files Modified:** 1 (`__manifest__.py`)
