# ESG Report Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The ESG report system was generating the same comprehensive report content regardless of the selected report type (Environmental, Social, Governance, or Comprehensive). All reports were showing identical content instead of being tailored to their specific focus areas.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `ESGReportWizard.action_generate_esg_report()` method in `facilities_management_module/wizard/esg_report_wizard.py`. The method was preparing the same report data regardless of the `report_type` field value, always including all ESG metrics and using the same template.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified ESG Report Wizard (`esg_report_wizard.py`)

**File:** `facilities_management_module/wizard/esg_report_wizard.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `action_generate_esg_report()` method to use different data preparation methods based on report type
- Added four new methods for preparing different report types:
  - `_prepare_environmental_report()` - Focuses on environmental metrics
  - `_prepare_social_report()` - Focuses on social impact metrics  
  - `_prepare_governance_report()` - Focuses on governance and compliance metrics
  - `_prepare_comprehensive_report()` - Includes all ESG metrics

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Before: Same data for all report types
report_data = {
    'wizard': self,
    'assets': assets,
    'total_assets': len(assets),
    'environmental_assets': assets.filtered(lambda a: a.environmental_impact),
    'social_assets': assets.filtered(lambda a: a.safety_compliance or a.accessibility_compliant),
    'governance_assets': assets.filtered(lambda a: a.regulatory_compliance),
    'compliance_rate': self._calculate_compliance_rate(assets),
    'environmental_metrics': self._calculate_environmental_metrics(assets),
    'social_metrics': self._calculate_social_metrics(assets),
    'governance_metrics': self._calculate_governance_metrics(assets),
    'generation_date': fields.Date.today(),
}

# After: Different data based on report type
if self.report_type == 'environmental':
    report_data = self._prepare_environmental_report(assets)
elif self.report_type == 'social':
    report_data = self._prepare_social_report(assets)
elif self.report_type == 'governance':
    report_data = self._prepare_governance_report(assets)
else:  # comprehensive
    report_data = self._prepare_comprehensive_report(assets)
```

### 2. Updated PDF Template (`esg_report_pdf.xml`)

**File:** `facilities_management_module/reports/esg_report_pdf.xml`

**Changes:**
- Made sections conditional based on report type
- Added different asset tables for each report type
- Updated recommendations to be specific to each report type
- Enhanced report summary to show report-specific information

**Key Changes:**

#### Header Section
- Added dynamic report title and description based on report type
- Shows different descriptions for each report type

#### Metrics Sections
- Environmental metrics only show for Environmental and Comprehensive reports
- Social metrics only show for Social and Comprehensive reports  
- Governance metrics only show for Governance and Comprehensive reports

#### Asset Details Section
- **Environmental Report:** Shows environmental impact, energy rating, carbon footprint, renewable energy
- **Social Report:** Shows safety compliance, accessibility, social impact score
- **Governance Report:** Shows regulatory compliance, certifications, next audit date
- **Comprehensive Report:** Shows all ESG-related fields

#### Recommendations Section
- **Environmental Report:** Focuses on energy efficiency, renewable energy, carbon reduction
- **Social Report:** Focuses on safety, accessibility, social impact improvement
- **Governance Report:** Focuses on compliance, certifications, audit scheduling
- **Comprehensive Report:** Includes recommendations for all ESG areas

## Testing

Created `test_esg_report_types.py` to verify that:
- Different report types generate different data structures
- Each report type has appropriate metrics and content
- Asset filtering works correctly for each report type

## Benefits

1. **Focused Reporting:** Each report type now provides relevant, focused information
2. **Better User Experience:** Users can generate reports specific to their needs
3. **Improved Decision Making:** Targeted reports help with specific ESG initiatives
4. **Professional Presentation:** Each report type has appropriate content and recommendations

## Usage

To generate different ESG reports:

1. Navigate to **Assets > ESG Reports > Generate ESG Report**
2. Select the desired report type:
   - **Environmental Report** for environmental impact analysis
   - **Social Impact Report** for social responsibility metrics
   - **Governance Report** for compliance and governance tracking
   - **Comprehensive ESG Report** for complete ESG overview
3. Configure date range, asset filters, and options
4. Click **Generate ESG Report**

Each report type will now generate content specific to its focus area, providing more relevant and actionable information for ESG management.
